# Thermodynamic-and-kinetic-analysis-of-a-metabolic-pathway-enabling-the-anaerobic-production-of-PHB
This project contains the computational tools used in the Master Thesis titled 'Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of a metabolic pathway enabling the anaerobic production of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate' by Marco Valentim Becker, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Life Science & Technology.
To use the tools developed in this study, the packages equilibrator-api(version 0.2.9) and equilibrator-pathway(version 0.1.2)  packages need to be installed. A Python 3 virtual environment should be used to use these tools, as it suggested in the README pages of the links above.
Other packages such as numpy (version 1.18.1), pandas (version 1.0.1), matplotlib (version 3.1.3) were also used.
